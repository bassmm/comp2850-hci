# Job Stories — Week 6 Needs-Finding

## Story S1: Task Count Badge
**Situation**: When I open the task manager app or glance at my browser tab  
**Motivation**: I want to see the total number of incomplete tasks at a glance  
**Outcome**: So I can quickly assess my workload without scrolling through the full list  
**Underlying need**: Because constantly counting manually how many tasks I have left wastes time and breaks my flow

**Evidence**: Participant C (notes L198)  
**Inclusion risk**: Cognitive  
**Type**: Job story  
**WCAG**: N/A

## Story S2: Keyboard-First Navigation
**Situation**: When I'm planning my day at a laptop using a task manager without a mouse  
**Motivation**: I want full keyboard shortcuts for all core actions, including activating icon-only controls  
**Outcome**: So I can maintain a fast, uninterrupted workflow without switching input methods  
**Underlying need**: Because breaking keyboard flow to use the mouse slows me down and makes structured routines harder to follow

**Evidence**: Participant A (notes L45)  
**Inclusion risk**: Motor, Keyboard-only  
**Type**: Job story  
**WCAG**: 2.1.1 Keyboard (A)

## Story S3: Reduce Notification Overload
**Situation**: When I receive lots of task-related notifications across the day  
**Motivation**: I want simple controls to mute, group, or prioritise alerts  
**Outcome**: So I can stay informed about critical tasks without feeling overwhelmed or ignoring everything  
**Underlying need**: Because constant pings increase anxiety and cause me to miss important reminders

**Evidence**: Participant B (notes L111)  
**Inclusion risk**: Cognitive, Anxiety, Low digital literacy  
**Type**: Job story  
**WCAG**: 3.2.4 Consistent Identification (AA)

## Story S4: Persistent "Nag Me" Reminders
**Situation**: When I have overdue or high-priority tasks that I keep putting off  
**Motivation**: I want persistent, escalating reminders that continue until I actually address the task  
**Outcome**: So I can avoid forgetting important work even when I dismiss or ignore earlier prompts  
**Underlying need**: Because attention lapses and procrastination mean one-off reminders are easy to miss

**Evidence**: Participant C (notes L242)  
**Inclusion risk**: Cognitive, Neurodivergent (ADHD)  
**Type**: Job story  
**WCAG**: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (A)

## Story S5: High-Contrast, Glare-Resistant View
**Situation**: When I'm checking my tasks on a phone or laptop in bright sunlight  
**Motivation**: I want a high-contrast, glare-resistant theme that is easy to toggle  
**Outcome**: So I can comfortably read and act on my tasks without straining my eyes  
**Underlying need**: Because low-contrast, bright interfaces become unreadable outdoors and make task tracking difficult

**Evidence**: Participant B (notes L144)  
**Inclusion risk**: Low vision, Colour-blind, Environmental  
**Type**: Job story  
**WCAG**: 1.4.3 Contrast Minimum (AA)
